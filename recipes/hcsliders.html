  <h3>Hot Ham and Cheese Sliders!</h3>
  <p>These warm, cheesy hot ham and cheese sliders are perfect for a crowd and a delightful simple lunch that comes together in less than a half hour.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced shallots</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chopped parsley</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (12-count package) Hawaiian slider rolls</li>
    <li>½ pound thin-sliced deli ham</li>
    <li>½ pound sliced Swiss cheese, about 12 slices</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Directions:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 190C (375F).</li>
    <li>Chop parsley, mince shallots, mix with softended butter and mustard until it becomes a homogenous, spreadable mixture.</li>
    <li>Using a serrated knife, cut the slider buns through the middle into two halves, dividing the tops and bottoms while keeping each slider bun connected.</li>
    <li>Place the opened rolls on a sheet pan or baking dish, and evenly arrange half the Swiss cheese on the bottom bun. Top with the ham, overlapping slightly as you lay down each slice. Arrange the remaining slices of cheese on top of the ham, and close with the slider bun tops. </li>
    <li>Use a spoon or butter knife to smear the softened compound butter all over the tops of the sliders.</li>
    <li>Loosely cover the sliders with aluminum foil and bake for 10 minutes.
      After 10 minutes, remove the foil and bake for another 5 minutes or until the tops of the sliders are crisp and golden brown. 
      Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.</li>
